# NumPy
## What is NumPy?

A library for Python, NumPy lets you work with huge, multidimensional matrices and arrays. 
Along with that, it provides a gamut of high-level functions to perform mathematical operations on these structures.

## Why use NumPy?
* Numpy provides efficient storage
* It also provides better ways of handling data for processing
* It is fast
* It is easy to learn
* NumPy uses relatively less memory to store data
